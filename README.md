1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  A university was looking for software to help its computer science advisors access course information for students. The program should be able to add courses to a database, print a list of courses and their prerequisites, and enable a user to search for a class and see it's details.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   Throughout the course, learning about the different types of storage systems helped me to not only see how each has its purpose but also that using the wrong system can have a large impact on performance and memory usage. Data structures are very important because they help create effective programs. Without them, searching for data can be tedious and time consuming.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   A big issue that I had was infinite loops. Most of the data structures liked to use alot of if, else, and while statements. It really highlighted the importance of taking your time while crafting the initial version of a function or your program. In addition, taking time to review sections after you have completed them enables you to catch any possible misses that can lead to infinite loops that may show in an area you don't suspect based on how the issue is presenting.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   It really highlighted for me how sometimes a good deal of work in the beginning pays off in the long run. For the final project, using a binary search tree definitely requires the most set up in crafting the program. However, once that is completed, the tree ends up naturally doing alot of the work for you. It also ends up being easily adaptable if changes need to occur or more is to be added. This course really helped highlight that picking the systems and alogritms you are comfortable with is not always the right solution. Knowing all your tools and then picking the right one is key.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   Similar to the answer above, writing code in a generic, all purpose fashion does a great deal for your future self when changes come. Using common algorithms can allow freedom or easy maintenance on code if changes arise in the future. It finally impressed on me how critical programmer notes are in code. These go a long way in helping someone to see how all the pieces fit together
